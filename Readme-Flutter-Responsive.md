# Flutter Responsive and Adaptive UI

## Lock UI into Portrait Mode
- In main.dart, main()

```dart
void main() {
  // NOTE: Ensure Portrait mode works properly
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();

  // Setting orientation. Use then because
  // setPreferredOrientations returns a Future
  SystemChrome.setPreferredOrientations([
    DeviceOrientation.portraitUp,
  ]).then(
    (value) {
      // Do the regular runApp...
      runApp(
        MaterialApp()....
      );
    }
  );
}
```

## MediaQuery - Get Device's Width & Height
```dart
final width = MediaQuery.of(context).size.width;
final height = MediaQuery.of(context).size.height;

// viewInsets - To see space taken from overlaying component (e.g. keyboard) overlapping screen
final keyboardSpace = MediaQuery.of(context).viewInsets.bottom;
```

## Understanding Widget Size Constraints (Academind explains)
- All Widgets get sized based on their size preferences and parent widget size constraints
- However, size preferences vary for different Widgets
- E.g. Scaffold's (Parent) Constraints:
  - Height: Max device height
  - Width: Max device width
- E.g. Column's (Child) Preferences:
  - Height: As much as possible (INFINITY)
  - Width: As much as needed by children
- E.g. Row's (Child) Preferences:
  - Height: As much as needed by children
  - Width: As much as possible (INFINITY)

Hence with Scaffold's constraints, Column and Row display fine, even Column wants height to be INFINITE and Row wants width to be INFINITE.

### Problem: When Parent has no constraint and Child wants INFINITE width or height
- E.g. Column's (Parent) Constraints:
  - Height: No Constraint
  - Width: Available width from screen / remaining width from parent
- E.g. Column / ListView's (Child) Preferences:
  - Height: As much as possible (INFINITY)
  - Width: As much as needed by children

With no constraint on height and child wants INFINITE height, Flutter throws an Exception or out of the boundary of the screen.

### To Fix: Add Expanded to set constraints of the Child
- E.g. Expanded's (Parent) Constraints:
  - Height: Actual height of the Child
  - Width: Available width from screen / remaining width from parent
- E.g. ListView's (Child) Preferences:
  - Height: As much as possible (INFINITY)
  - Width: As much as needed by children


## SafeArea
- Wrap Scaffold's body with SafeArea() to make sure Widget does NOT overlap with camera hole and notification bar
- Set useSafeArea: true in ShowModalBottomSheet()
```dart

return Scaffold(
  appBar: AppBar(
    ...
  ),
  body: SafeArea(
    child: Column(
      children: [
        Chart(expenses: _registeredExpenses),
        Expanded(child: mainContent),
      ],
    ),
  ),
);

void _openAddExpenseOverlay() {
  showModalBottomSheet(
    useSafeArea: true,
    isScrollControlled: true,
    context: context,
    builder: (ctx) => NewExpense(onAddExpense: _addExpense),
  );
}
```

## LayoutBuilder
- LayoutBuilder can be used to build dynamic layout for different screen sizes
```dart
@override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final keyboardSpace = MediaQuery.of(context).viewInsets.bottom;

    return LayoutBuilder(
      builder: (context, constraints) {

        // We can query different constraints values
        final width = constraints.maxWidth;

        return SingleChildScrollView(
          child: Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.fromLTRB(16, 48, 16, 16),
            child: Column(
              crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
              children: [

                // Dart supports if condition, but no curly brackets
                if (width > 600)
                  Row(
                    children: [
                      Expanded(
                        child: TextField(
                          controller: _titleController,
                          maxLength: 50,
                          keyboardType: TextInputType.text,
                          decoration: const InputDecoration(
                            label: Text('Title'),
                          ),
                        ),
                      ),
                      const SizedBox(width: 20),
                      Expanded(
                        child: Padding(
                          padding: const EdgeInsets.only(bottom: 25.0),
                          child: TextField(
                            controller: _amountController,
                            keyboardType: TextInputType.number,
                            decoration: const InputDecoration(
                              prefixText: '\$',
                              label: Text('Amount'),
                            ),
                          ),
                        ),
                      )
                    ],
                  )
                else
                  Column()
            ),
          ),
        );
      },
    );
  }
            
```
