# Animations
- Explicit
  - You control the entire animation
  - More control but also more complexity
  - Can often be avoided (by using pre-built Wdigets)
- Implicit
  - Flutter controls the animation
  - Less control and therefore less complexity
  - Use pre-built animation widgets as often as possible!
